# Product Requirements Document: Conductor

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines **Conductor** - a universal framework for human-AI collaborative software development that addresses fundamental weaknesses in current AI-assisted programming while amplifying the complementary strengths of human strategic thinking and AI tactical execution through a mode-based user experience.

### Core Problem Statement

Current AI-assisted development suffers from systemic issues:
- **Human cognitive laziness**: Developers default to accepting AI solutions without deep understanding
- **AI over-complexity**: AI generates unnecessarily complex solutions without real-world constraints
- **Shared weakness amplification**: Both humans and AI struggle with meta-reasoning and documentation
- **Ownership ambiguity**: Unclear responsibility boundaries lead to quality degradation
- **Skill atrophy**: Over-reliance on AI reduces human competence over time
- **Context fragmentation**: Knowledge scattered across sessions with no systematic retention

### Solution Vision

**Conductor** - a mode-based collaborative system where humans maintain strategic control while working through distinct development phases, each with specialized AI assistance, visual design, and interaction patterns that:
- Make quality practices the path of least resistance
- Enforce standards through automation, not discipline
- Provide progressive complexity disclosure
- Maintain human expertise through guided learning
- Create feedback loops that improve both human judgment and AI effectiveness

## Core Principles

### 1. Human Strategic Control
- Humans make architectural decisions, business logic choices, and quality judgments
- AI provides options with trade-offs rather than single solutions
- Final approval always remains with humans
- System escalates to human review when confidence thresholds are exceeded

### 2. AI Tactical Excellence
- AI handles repetitive implementation, testing, and documentation tasks
- Specialized agents optimize for specific domains (coding, review, architecture, testing)
- AI provides explanations and alternatives on demand
- Continuous validation prevents hallucination propagation

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
- Start with simple, high-impact actions
- Reveal complexity only when necessary
- Provide multiple abstraction levels for different user needs
- Allow drill-down from summary to implementation details

### 4. Competence Preservation
- Mandatory learning modes prevent skill atrophy
- Socratic dialogue for complex topics
- Regular challenges to maintain human expertise
- Track and develop competence gaps

### 5. Quality by Design
- Automated quality gates at multiple levels
- Review guides that structure human judgment
- Continuous monitoring and feedback
- Fail-fast with rapid recovery mechanisms

- Layout changes per mode
- Ambient visual indicators

## Initial User Experience

### Entry Point

- Simple, welcoming interface: "What's on your mind?"
- Multiple input options: text, sketch upload, document, voice
- No forms or templates initially

### Adaptive Interface

- Conversational start that builds understanding
- Visual building of ideas alongside chat
- Progressive discovery through dialogue
- Clear commitment levels (explore ‚Üí prototype ‚Üí build)

### Key UX Principles

1. **No cognitive load**: Interface guides naturally
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Details emerge as needed
3. **Visual feedback**: See ideas take shape in real-time
4. **Multiple exit points**: Save, share, or continue later
5. **Context preservation**: Never lose work or ideas

## Transition to Execution

- Seamless move from planning to building
- "Magic moment" where ideas become running code
- Clear value proposition at each transition point
- Time estimates for deliverables

## Mode Memory & Context

- Each mode maintains its own context
- Smart context transfer between modes
- No manual context management required
- Historical decision preservation

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### In Discovery

- ‚ùå Jumping to solutions too fast
- ‚ùå Making assumptions without validation
- ‚ùå Generic requirements gathering
- ‚ùå Losing the "why" behind the "what"

#### In Planning

- ‚ùå Over-planning distant futures
- ‚ùå False precision in estimates
- ‚ùå Skipping the "what success looks like" discussion
- ‚ùå Planning without discovery completion

# Conductor PRD Addendum Refined Discovery & Planning

## Initialization & Discovery Refinements

### Project Initialization

#### Zero-Friction Start

- **No project scaffolding required** - Conductor creates structure as needed
- **Single command entry**: `/conductor "describe your idea"`
- **Workspace detection**: Automatically detects existing code vs greenfield
- **Context inference**: Examines workspace for clues about project type

#### Discovery Conversation Flow

**Progressive Understanding Building**

1. **Problem First**: Start with the problem, not the solution

   - "Tell me about a recent time this was frustrating"
   - "Who else experiences this problem?"
   - "What happens if this doesn't get solved?"

2. **Concrete Examples**: Ground abstract ideas in specifics

   - "Walk me through your last grocery trip"
   - "Show me what you currently use"
   - "What broke down last time?"

3. **Success Vision**: Define what "better" looks like
   - "How would you know this is working?"
   - "What would change for your users?"
   - "What metrics matter?"

- Not a requirements document - a shared understanding artifact
- User can see their thoughts organized in real-time
- Editable and collaborative

#### Discovery Exit Criteria

Clear transition points when:

1. **Problem is well-understood** (can articulate to others)
2. **Success is defined** (measurable outcomes identified)
3. **Scope has boundaries** (explicit what's in/out)
4. **Commitment level is clear** (exploring vs building)

## Planning Mode Refinements

### Planning Philosophy

#### Just-In-Time Detail

- **Don't plan what you won't build soon** - Details become stale
- **Rolling wave planning** - Detail increases as work approaches
- **Aperture matches commitment** - Exploring = broad, Building = specific
