# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create Command Interface and Mode Switching System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement basic CLI command system with essential commands for Phase 1 functionality
# Details:
Build basic command parser to handle 'conductor init', 'conductor discover [prompt]', and 'conductor status' commands. Implement command validation and error handling for these core commands. Create simple help system showing available commands and their usage. Focus on clean argument parsing and user-friendly error messages. Ensure commands integrate properly with the core conductor functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test command parsing for the three core commands, verify argument handling for 'discover' command, validate help system output, test error handling for invalid commands and missing arguments, verify integration with init, discover, and status functionality
