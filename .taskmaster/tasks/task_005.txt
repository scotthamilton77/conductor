# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Discovery Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the Discovery mode with conversational problem exploration, vision building, and artifact generation - Phase 1 focus on CLI-based implementation
# Details:
Create Discovery mode class extending base Mode, implement conversation flow management using Claude API for problem exploration, build progressive understanding algorithms that ask follow-up questions based on user responses, create CLI-based interface for discovery conversations with clear prompts and feedback, implement problem-first conversation patterns with predefined question templates, design concrete example gathering workflows through interactive prompts, build success vision definition capabilities, create constraints and boundary identification features, implement insight capture and synthesis, create project.md generation and real-time updates during discovery process, design exit criteria validation with clear transition points to planning mode, and integrate with file-based state management system.

# Test Strategy:
Test conversation flow logic with Claude API, verify question generation quality and relevance, validate project.md generation and updates, test exit criteria evaluation for mode transitions, verify CLI interaction patterns, and test integration with file-based state management
