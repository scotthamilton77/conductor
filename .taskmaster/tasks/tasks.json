The new StandardLogger class wraps @std/log with ConsoleHandler and FileHandler, providing enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining our existing Logger interface.\n\nKey technical improvements: Colored console output with aiFormatter (blue/yellow/red for different levels), JSON structured file logging with jsonFormatter for machine parsing, proper TypeScript integration with LogRecord and BaseHandler types, and built-in file rotation eliminating custom implementation needs.\n\nArchitecture benefits: Reduced code complexity and maintenance burden, improved performance and memory management, standard Deno ecosystem integration, and enhanced reliability through battle-tested logging infrastructure. Configuration-driven setup preserved with proper level mapping and async file handling without resource leaks.\n\nThis refactor exemplifies the CLAUDE.md principle of preferring established open source libraries over reinventing functionality, resulting in more robust and maintainable code with superior features.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T19:23:17.215Z>",
