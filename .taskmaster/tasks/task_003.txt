# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build File-Based State Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the .conductor/ directory structure with markdown-based state persistence and Git-friendly format (Phase 1 - core functionality only)
# Details:
Create file system abstraction layer for .conductor/ directory management, implement markdown file handling with frontmatter parsing (using gray-matter library), design project.md template with proper YAML frontmatter schema, build basic mode-specific directory structure (discovery/, planning/, design/, build/, test/, polish/), implement basic file operations (create, read, write, delete), ensure Git-friendly formats with proper line endings, and implement config.json handling for Conductor settings. Phase 1 focuses on core functionality - advanced features like file watching, auto-save, concurrent access, backup/rollback, and complex synchronization will be implemented in later phases.

# Test Strategy:
Test basic file creation/read/write/delete operations, verify frontmatter parsing accuracy with gray-matter, test directory structure creation, validate Git-friendly file formats, and verify config.json handling
