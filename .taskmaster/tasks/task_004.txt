# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Mode-Based Framework Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core mode system foundation with basic Mode class architecture focused on Discovery mode for Phase 1 implementation
# Details:
Design basic Mode base class with simple state management for Discovery mode implementation, implement mode registry pattern for mode instantiation focusing on single mode initially, create mode-specific command parsing and routing for CLI interface, implement basic context preservation mechanisms for Discovery mode operations, design mode-specific prompt management for single AI agent architecture, build foundation for mode switching without UI components, implement basic memory management for Discovery mode artifacts, and establish CLI-based mode indication and feedback systems.

# Test Strategy:
Test Mode class instantiation for Discovery mode, verify basic state management functionality, validate CLI-based command routing, test context preservation within Discovery mode, verify mode-specific prompt handling, and test basic memory management for artifacts
