# Product Requirements Document: Human-AI Collaboration Development System

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines a comprehensive system that enhances the Claude Code developer experience by orchestrating human strategic decision-making with AI tactical execution. The system addresses fundamental weaknesses in both human and AI capabilities while amplifying their respective strengths through carefully designed workflows, tools, and interaction patterns.

### Core Problem Statement

Current AI-assisted development suffers from:
- Humans defaulting to cognitive laziness and poor attention to detail
- AI generating overly complex solutions without real-world understanding
- Dangerous amplification of shared weaknesses (poor meta-reasoning, documentation aversion)
- Lack of clear ownership boundaries leading to diffused responsibility
- No systematic approach to maintaining human expertise while maximizing productivity

### Solution Overview

A conductor-model system where humans orchestrate specialized AI agents through structured workflows that:
- Make the right thing the easiest thing
- Enforce quality through automation, not discipline
- Provide progressive disclosure of complexity
- Maintain human strategic control while delegating tactical execution
- Create feedback loops that improve both human judgment and AI effectiveness

## Appendix A: Example Interactions

### A.1 Quick Win Example
```
Developer: /next-win

Conductor: I found 3 quick wins in order of impact:
1. 🔴 Fix broken login test (blocking CI) - 15 min
2. 🟡 Add missing error handling in API - 30 min  
3. 🟢 Update outdated dependencies - 45 min

Which would you like to tackle?

Developer: 1

Coder: I'll fix the login test. The issue is a missing mock for the new 
email validation. Here's the fix...

[Shows minimal diff]

Developer: looks good, apply it

System: ✅ Applied fix, running tests... All tests passing!
Next win available with /next-win
```

### A.2 Feature Development Example
```
Developer: /feature "add password reset"

Architect: Here are 3 approaches for password reset:

1. 📧 Email-based (traditional)
   - Pros: Familiar UX, no SMS costs
   - Cons: Email delivery issues
   
2. 📱 SMS-based (modern)
   - Pros: Higher delivery rate, faster
   - Cons: Costs, phone number required
   
3. 🔐 Magic link (passwordless)
   - Pros: Most secure, best UX
   - Cons: Bigger architecture change

Developer: 1, but with rate limiting

Conductor: Breaking this into 4 tasks:
- [ ] Email service integration
- [ ] Reset token generation
- [ ] Reset form UI
- [ ] Rate limiting

Starting with email service...
```

### A.3 Learning Mode Example
```
Developer: /learning-mode
System: 📚 Learning mode activated

Developer: Why did the login test fail?

Coder: Great question! Let me guide you through debugging this:

First, what error message are you seeing in the test output?

Developer: "Cannot read property 'validate' of undefined"

Coder: That's a classic sign of a missing mock. In our test, we're 
calling a method that depends on an external service. 

Can you find where we're calling 'validate' in the login flow?

Developer: Found it - emailValidator.validate(email)

Coder: Excellent! Now, in your test file, do you see where we set up
mocks for external services?
