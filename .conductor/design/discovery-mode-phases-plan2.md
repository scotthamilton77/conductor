# Discovery Mode Implementation: Phased Development Strategy - Phase 2

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a focused 4-phase development strategy for implementing Discovery Mode within the Conductor framework. The approach builds incrementally from basic conversation capabilities to a sophisticated problem exploration system, with each phase delivering working, testable software that provides real value.

Discovery Mode is designed to help users explore problems through conversational discovery using Socratic questioning methods. Unlike traditional requirements gathering, it guides users through progressive understanding of their problem space, stakeholder needs, and success criteria through patient, empathetic dialogue.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Start Simple, Add Sophistication**: Begin with basic conversation flow, progressively add advanced features
- **Working Software Each Phase**: Every phase delivers testable, usable functionality
- **Discovery-First Focus**: Stay focused on discovery capabilities without premature mode expansion
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each phase builds naturally on the previous one
- **User Value Driven**: Every feature serves the core goal of better problem understanding

### Phase Boundaries

Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria and delivers standalone value:

- **Phase 1**: Basic conversation → persistent insights
- **Phase 2**: Linear questioning → adaptive Socratic dialogue  
- **Phase 3**: Single session → multi-topic knowledge building
- **Phase 4**: Functional system → production-ready experience

### Explicit Non-Dependencies

Discovery Mode implementation does **not** require:

- Planning Mode, Build Mode, or other modes
- Specialized agents (Complexity Watchdog, Security Agent)
- Cross-mode workflow management
- Advanced AI capabilities beyond conversation

### Future Mode Integration Points

These features are designed for extensibility but work standalone:

**Mode Transition Interface**:

- Discovery generates completion criteria and transition suggestions
- Artifacts include metadata for consumption by future modes
- **Discovery works fully without other modes**

**Agent Integration Hooks**:

- Discovery Mode includes evaluation points for cross-cutting agents
- Agent feedback can be incorporated into conversations
- **Discovery functions completely without agents**

**Cross-Mode Context**:

- Discovery saves insights in formats consumable by other modes
- Artifact generation includes structured data for planning/building
- **All Discovery value is available without other modes**

## Phase 2: Sophisticated Conversation System

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks  
**Functional Goal**: "Advanced Socratic questioning with natural conversation flow"

### Epic 2.1: Question Management System

**Deliverables**:

- `QuestionTodoManager` with intelligent question queuing
- Comprehensive question template library with variables and context requirements
- Question dependency tracking and priority management
- Dynamic question selection based on conversation context
- Question flow control preventing overwhelming users

**Key Features**:

```typescript
interface QuestionTodo {
  questionId: QuestionId;
  question: Question;
  priority: QuestionPriority;
  status: QuestionStatus;
  category: SocraticCategory;
  dependencies?: QuestionId[];
  context: QuestionContext;
  userDeferredReason?: string;
}

class QuestionTodoManager {
  async queueQuestion(question: Question, priority: QuestionPriority): Promise<QuestionId>;
  async getNextQuestion(): Promise<QuestionTodo | null>;
  async markQuestionAnswered(questionId: QuestionId): Promise<void>;
  async deferQuestion(questionId: QuestionId, reason?: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

- Questions are contextually appropriate and avoid repetition
- Users aren't overwhelmed with multiple questions at once
- Question dependencies ensure logical conversation flow
- System gracefully handles user topic changes

### Epic 2.2: Enhanced Conversation Flow

**Deliverables**:

- State machine-based conversation management
- Discovery stage tracking within conversations
- Enhanced context tracking with theme detection
- Conversation transition patterns (opening, exploration loops, transitions, exits)
- Progressive disclosure of conversation complexity

**Discovery Stages**:

```typescript
enum DiscoveryStage {
  INITIAL_EXPLORATION = "initial_exploration",
  PROBLEM_DEFINITION = "problem_definition",
  STAKEHOLDER_MAPPING = "stakeholder_mapping",
  NEED_EXPLORATION = "need_exploration", 
  SUCCESS_DEFINITION = "success_definition",
  CONSTRAINT_IDENTIFICATION = "constraint_identification",
  VALIDATION = "validation",
  SYNTHESIS = "synthesis"
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

- Conversations feel natural and purposeful
- Discovery progresses through logical stages
- Context is maintained throughout long conversations
- Clear completion criteria for discovery phases

### Epic 2.3: Sub-modes & Adaptation

**Deliverables**:

- Discovery sub-modes: Guided, Responsive, Collaborative
- User behavior detection and adaptive interaction styles
- Suggestion system that offers help when appropriate
- User preference learning and mode switching
- Contextual assistance without overwhelming

**Sub-mode Behaviors**:

```typescript
enum DiscoverySubMode {
  GUIDED = "guided",        // AI proactively suggests directions
  RESPONSIVE = "responsive", // AI waits for user direction
  COLLABORATIVE = "collaborative" // Adaptive based on user cues
}

interface SuggestionTriggers {
  onSilence: boolean;      // Offer suggestions after user pause
  onUncertainty: boolean;  // When user expresses confusion
  onCompletion: boolean;   // After answering questions
  onTopicShift: boolean;   // When user changes subjects
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

- Interaction style matches user preferences and needs
- Users feel supported without being led
- Mode switching happens naturally based on user behavior
- Suggestions are helpful and well-timed

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 2 Testing  

- **Unit Tests**: Question management and conversation state transitions
- **Integration Tests**: Full conversation flows with complex scenarios
- **UX Testing**: Sub-mode behaviors and adaptive responses

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Success  

- [ ] Conversations feel natural and avoid repetition
- [ ] Socratic questioning leads to deeper insights
- [ ] Users report discovery process helps clarify thinking
- [ ] Different interaction styles serve different user preferences
