# Discovery Mode Implementation: Phased Development Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a focused 4-phase development strategy for implementing Discovery Mode within the Conductor framework. The approach builds incrementally from basic conversation capabilities to a sophisticated problem exploration system, with each phase delivering working, testable software that provides real value.

Discovery Mode is designed to help users explore problems through conversational discovery using Socratic questioning methods. Unlike traditional requirements gathering, it guides users through progressive understanding of their problem space, stakeholder needs, and success criteria through patient, empathetic dialogue.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Start Simple, Add Sophistication**: Begin with basic conversation flow, progressively add advanced features
- **Working Software Each Phase**: Every phase delivers testable, usable functionality
- **Discovery-First Focus**: Stay focused on discovery capabilities without premature mode expansion
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each phase builds naturally on the previous one
- **User Value Driven**: Every feature serves the core goal of better problem understanding

### Phase Boundaries

Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria and delivers standalone value:

- **Phase 1**: Basic conversation → persistent insights
- **Phase 2**: Linear questioning → adaptive Socratic dialogue  
- **Phase 3**: Single session → multi-topic knowledge building
- **Phase 4**: Functional system → production-ready experience

### Explicit Non-Dependencies

Discovery Mode implementation does **not** require:

- Planning Mode, Build Mode, or other modes
- Specialized agents (Complexity Watchdog, Security Agent)
- Cross-mode workflow management
- Advanced AI capabilities beyond conversation

### Future Mode Integration Points

These features are designed for extensibility but work standalone:

**Mode Transition Interface**:

- Discovery generates completion criteria and transition suggestions
- Artifacts include metadata for consumption by future modes
- **Discovery works fully without other modes**

**Agent Integration Hooks**:

- Discovery Mode includes evaluation points for cross-cutting agents
- Agent feedback can be incorporated into conversations
- **Discovery functions completely without agents**

**Cross-Mode Context**:

- Discovery saves insights in formats consumable by other modes
- Artifact generation includes structured data for planning/building
- **All Discovery value is available without other modes**

## Phase 4: Advanced Discovery Capabilities

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks  
**Functional Goal**: "Production-ready discovery with sophisticated analysis"

### Epic 4.1: Enhanced UX & Robustness

**Deliverables**:

- Polished CLI experience with colors, progress indicators, and clear feedback
- Comprehensive error handling with recovery suggestions
- Performance optimization for large knowledge bases
- Command completion and interactive help systems
- Configuration management and user preferences

**UX Enhancements**:

- Visual progress indicators for discovery stages
- Color-coded feedback and status messages  
- Interactive command completion
- Contextual help and guidance
- Clear error messages with suggested actions

**Success Criteria**:

- CLI feels professional and responsive
- Users can recover gracefully from errors
- Performance remains good with large conversation histories
- New users can discover capabilities easily

### Epic 4.2: Advanced Analysis

**Deliverables**:

- Pattern recognition across conversations and topics
- Sophisticated assumption detection and validation
- Insight synthesis and contradiction detection
- Emotional driver analysis from user responses
- Automated insight quality assessment

**Analysis Capabilities**:

```typescript
interface AdvancedAnalysis {
  async findRecurringThemes(history: ConversationHistory): Promise<Theme[]>;
  async identifyAssumptions(statements: Statement[]): Promise<Assumption[]>;
  async detectEmotionalDrivers(responses: UserResponse[]): Promise<EmotionalDriver[]>;
  async synthesizeProblemStatement(insights: Insight[]): Promise<ProblemStatement>;
  async findConflictingInsights(): Promise<ConflictAnalysis[]>;
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

- System identifies patterns users might miss
- Hidden assumptions are surfaced for validation
- Emotional context is captured and utilized
- Contradictions are detected and resolved

### Epic 4.3: Comprehensive Artifacts

**Deliverables**:

- Rich project document generation with visual elements
- Stakeholder mapping with relationship diagrams
- Constraint analysis with impact assessment
- Success metrics definition with measurement strategies
- Comprehensive conversation summaries and insights reports

**Artifact Types**:

```typescript
interface DiscoveryArtifacts {
  projectDocument: ProjectDocument;      // Living project overview
  stakeholderMap: StakeholderMap;       // Visual stakeholder relationships
  constraintAnalysis: ConstraintAnalysis; // Detailed constraint impact
  successMetrics: SuccessMetrics;       // Measurable success criteria
  insightReport: InsightReport;         // Key discoveries and patterns
  validationPlan: ValidationPlan;       // Next steps for validation
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

- Generated artifacts are comprehensive and useful
- Documents serve as effective communication tools
- Artifacts evolve as discoveries progress
- Visual elements enhance understanding

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 4 Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Advanced analysis and artifact generation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end discovery workflows
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Real discovery scenarios with stakeholders
- **Performance Testing**: Production-scale usage patterns

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 4 Success

- [ ] System is production-ready with robust error handling
- [ ] Advanced analysis surfaces insights users wouldn't find alone
- [ ] Generated artifacts are valuable communication tools
- [ ] Discovery process demonstrably improves project outcomes
