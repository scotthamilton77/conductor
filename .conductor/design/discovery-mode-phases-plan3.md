# Discovery Mode Implementation: Phased Development Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a focused 4-phase development strategy for implementing Discovery Mode within the Conductor framework. The approach builds incrementally from basic conversation capabilities to a sophisticated problem exploration system, with each phase delivering working, testable software that provides real value.

Discovery Mode is designed to help users explore problems through conversational discovery using Socratic questioning methods. Unlike traditional requirements gathering, it guides users through progressive understanding of their problem space, stakeholder needs, and success criteria through patient, empathetic dialogue.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Start Simple, Add Sophistication**: Begin with basic conversation flow, progressively add advanced features
- **Working Software Each Phase**: Every phase delivers testable, usable functionality
- **Discovery-First Focus**: Stay focused on discovery capabilities without premature mode expansion
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each phase builds naturally on the previous one
- **User Value Driven**: Every feature serves the core goal of better problem understanding

### Phase Boundaries

Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria and delivers standalone value:

- **Phase 1**: Basic conversation ‚Üí persistent insights
- **Phase 2**: Linear questioning ‚Üí adaptive Socratic dialogue  
- **Phase 3**: Single session ‚Üí multi-topic knowledge building
- **Phase 4**: Functional system ‚Üí production-ready experience

### Explicit Non-Dependencies

Discovery Mode implementation does **not** require:

- Planning Mode, Build Mode, or other modes
- Specialized agents (Complexity Watchdog, Security Agent)
- Cross-mode workflow management
- Advanced AI capabilities beyond conversation

### Future Mode Integration Points

These features are designed for extensibility but work standalone:

**Mode Transition Interface**:

- Discovery generates completion criteria and transition suggestions
- Artifacts include metadata for consumption by future modes
- **Discovery works fully without other modes**

**Agent Integration Hooks**:

- Discovery Mode includes evaluation points for cross-cutting agents
- Agent feedback can be incorporated into conversations
- **Discovery functions completely without agents**

**Cross-Mode Context**:

- Discovery saves insights in formats consumable by other modes
- Artifact generation includes structured data for planning/building
- **All Discovery value is available without other modes**

## Phase 3: Multi-Topic & Knowledge Management

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks  
**Functional Goal**: "Persistent knowledge building across multiple discovery topics"

### Epic 3.1: Topic Management System

**Deliverables**:

- Multiple active topic support with unique topic IDs
- Topic dashboard showing active topics and progress
- Seamless topic resumption with full context restoration
- Topic creation, switching, and archiving capabilities
- Topic timeline and activity tracking

**Key Components**:

```typescript
interface TopicSummary {
  topicId: TopicId;
  title: string;
  priority: TopicPriority;
  lastActivity: Date;
  discoveryProgress: ProgressIndicator;
  unreadInsights: number;
  nextAction?: string;
  activeStages: DiscoveryStage[];
  keyConstraints: string[];
}

interface TopicManagementInterface {
  async listActiveTopics(): Promise<TopicSummary[]>;
  async resumeTopic(topicId: TopicId): Promise<ConversationContext>;
  async createNewTopic(title: string): Promise<TopicId>;
  async switchToTopic(topicId: TopicId): Promise<void>;
}
```

**User Experience**:

```text
üå± Discovery Mode - Your Active Topics

üìã Active Topics (3):
‚îå‚îÄ üî• CRITICAL: Authentication Security (2 hours ago)
‚îÇ  Discovery Progress: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 80% | 3 new insights
‚îÇ  Next Action: Review security requirements
‚îî‚îÄ ‚≠ê HIGH: User Onboarding Flow (yesterday)
   Discovery Progress: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 60% | Ready for input
   Next Action: "Tell me about first-time user goals"
```

**Success Criteria**:

- Users can manage multiple discovery topics simultaneously
- Context switching is seamless and preserves conversation state
- Topic dashboard provides clear overview of all active work
- No information is lost when switching between topics

### Epic 3.2: Stage Navigation & Change Impact

**Deliverables**:

- Non-immutable stage navigation within topics
- Stage revision tracking and history management
- Change impact assessment when users revise earlier discoveries
- Stage jump capabilities with preserved context
- Conflict detection and resolution for contradictory insights

**Change Management**:

```typescript
interface StageRevision {
  revisionId: RevisionId;
  topicId: TopicId;
  stageId: DiscoveryStage;
  timestamp: Date;
  changes: Change[];
  reason: string;
  impactedArtifacts: ArtifactId[];
}

interface ImpactAssessment {
  affectedStages: DiscoveryStage[];
  impactedTopics: TopicId[];
  outdatedArtifacts: ArtifactId[];
  conflictingInsights: InsightId[];
  recommendedActions: RecommendedAction[];
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

- Users can freely navigate backward to revise earlier discoveries
- System tracks what changes when users update previous insights
- Impact of changes is clearly communicated to users
- No work is lost when revising earlier stages

### Epic 3.3: Knowledge Capture & Basic Search

**Deliverables**:

- Real-time knowledge capture during conversations
- Entity extraction (people, problems, constraints, goals)
- Relationship mapping between discovered entities
- Basic search capabilities across all topics and sessions
- Knowledge base persistence with structured storage

**Knowledge Structure**:

```typescript
interface DiscoveryKnowledgeBase {
  topics: Map<TopicId, TopicGraph>;
  entities: Map<EntityId, EntityRecord>;
  relationships: Relationship[];
  insights: Insight[];
  patterns: DiscoveredPattern[];
  sessions: Map<SessionId, SessionRecord>;
}

interface BasicSearchCapabilities {
  searchByText(query: string): Promise<SearchResult[]>;
  searchByEntityType(entityType: EntityType): Promise<EntityRecord[]>;
  searchByTopic(topicId: TopicId): Promise<TopicSearchResult>;
  searchInsightsByTag(tags: string[]): Promise<Insight[]>;
}
```

**File Structure**:

```text
.conductor/modes/discovery/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-2024-12-29.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-2024-12-29.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge/

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ current-knowledge-base.json
```

**Success Criteria**:

- All discoveries are automatically captured and organized
- Users can search across all previous conversations
- Entity relationships are preserved and queryable
- Knowledge persists and grows across multiple sessions
