# Discovery Mode Implementation: Phase 3 - Multi-Topic Knowledge Management

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 transforms Discovery Mode from single-session conversations into a sophisticated multi-topic knowledge management system that enables persistent knowledge building across multiple discovery contexts. This phase delivers the advanced capabilities described in the Discovery Mode architecture document, including cross-topic relationship management, intelligent search and retrieval, change impact assessment, and sophisticated context preservation.

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks  
**Goal**: Deliver a comprehensive multi-topic knowledge management system that enables users to effectively manage multiple parallel discovery conversations while building and maintaining a growing knowledge base of insights, relationships, and patterns.

## Enhanced Phase Goals

The original goal of "persistent knowledge building across multiple discovery topics" is expanded to encompass:

### Primary Capabilities

- **Intelligent Knowledge Capture**: Real-time extraction and organization of entities, insights, and relationships during conversations
- **Advanced Search & Retrieval**: Powerful search capabilities across topics, entities, insights, and relationships
- **Change Impact Intelligence**: Sophisticated assessment of how revisions to earlier discoveries affect the entire knowledge base
- **Cross-Topic Analysis**: Automatic identification of relationships, patterns, and conflicts across topics
- **Performance at Scale**: Efficient handling of growing knowledge bases without degrading user experience

### User Experience Objectives

- **Cognitive Load Management**: Users can effectively manage 5-10+ active topics without feeling overwhelmed
- **Context Switching Efficiency**: Resuming any topic feels like naturally continuing a conversation
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Users easily find and build upon previous insights and discoveries
- **Progressive Understanding**: Knowledge base becomes more valuable over time, revealing patterns and connections
- **Change Confidence**: Users can revise earlier discoveries knowing the system will help them understand and manage impacts
