# Discovery Mode Implementation: Phased Development Strategy - Phase 1

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a focused 4-phase development strategy for implementing Discovery Mode within the Conductor framework. The approach builds incrementally from basic conversation capabilities to a sophisticated problem exploration system, with each phase delivering working, testable software that provides real value.

Discovery Mode is designed to help users explore problems through conversational discovery using Socratic questioning methods. Unlike traditional requirements gathering, it guides users through progressive understanding of their problem space, stakeholder needs, and success criteria through patient, empathetic dialogue.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Start Simple, Add Sophistication**: Begin with basic conversation flow, progressively add advanced features
- **Working Software Each Phase**: Every phase delivers testable, usable functionality
- **Discovery-First Focus**: Stay focused on discovery capabilities without premature mode expansion
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each phase builds naturally on the previous one
- **User Value Driven**: Every feature serves the core goal of better problem understanding

### Phase Boundaries

Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria and delivers standalone value:

- **Phase 1**: Basic conversation → persistent insights
- **Phase 2**: Linear questioning → adaptive Socratic dialogue  
- **Phase 3**: Single session → multi-topic knowledge building
- **Phase 4**: Functional system → production-ready experience

### Explicit Non-Dependencies

Discovery Mode implementation does **not** require:

- Planning Mode, Build Mode, or other modes
- Specialized agents (Complexity Watchdog, Security Agent)
- Cross-mode workflow management
- Advanced AI capabilities beyond conversation

### Future Mode Integration Points

These features are designed for extensibility but work standalone:

**Mode Transition Interface**:

- Discovery generates completion criteria and transition suggestions
- Artifacts include metadata for consumption by future modes
- **Discovery works fully without other modes**

**Agent Integration Hooks**:

- Discovery Mode includes evaluation points for cross-cutting agents
- Agent feedback can be incorporated into conversations
- **Discovery functions completely without agents**

**Cross-Mode Context**:

- Discovery saves insights in formats consumable by other modes
- Artifact generation includes structured data for planning/building
- **All Discovery value is available without other modes**

## Phase 1: Core Discovery Foundation

**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Functional Goal**: "Basic discovery conversations with persistent state"

### Epic 1.1: Infrastructure Foundation

**Deliverables**:

- `AbstractMode` base class with lifecycle methods (initialize, execute, cleanup)
- File-based state management with `.conductor/` directory structure
- Basic CLI framework with command parsing and configuration
- Logging system with structured output
- Error handling foundation with graceful degradation

**Key Files**:

```text
src/modes/abstract-mode.ts
src/services/file-operations.ts
src/cli/cli-framework.ts
src/config/config-manager.ts
src/utils/logger.ts
```

**Success Criteria**:

- CLI accepts commands and manages configuration
- File operations safely create/read/write state files
- Basic error handling prevents crashes
- Logging provides debugging visibility

### Epic 1.2: Basic DiscoveryMode

**Deliverables**:

- `DiscoveryMode` class extending `AbstractMode`
- Simple conversation state management (current topic, user input history)
- Basic question template system with 6 Socratic categories
- Simple conversation flow: greeting → problem exploration → insight capture
- Session persistence and basic resumption

**Key Components**:

```typescript
// Basic conversation state
interface ConversationState {
  currentTopic: string;
  conversationHistory: ConversationTurn[];
  extractedInsights: Insight[];
  sessionMetadata: SessionMetadata;
}

// Simple question templates
const BASIC_TEMPLATES = {
  clarification: ["When you say '{term}', what specifically does that mean?"],
  assumptions: ["What makes you believe that {assumption}?"],
  evidence: ["How do you know that {claim}?"],
  implications: ["What would happen if {scenario}?"],
  perspectives: ["Who else might see this differently?"],
  meta_questions: ["How does this relate to {previous_topic}?"]
};
```

**Success Criteria**:

- User can start discovery conversation with basic prompts
- System asks contextually appropriate follow-up questions
- Conversation state persists between sessions
- Basic insights are extracted and stored

### Epic 1.3: Essential Components

**Deliverables**:

- Basic `ConversationManager` for flow control
- Simple insight extraction from user responses
- `project.md` generation with discovered information
- CLI commands: `conductor discover [prompt]`, `conductor status`
- Basic conversation resumption

**File Structure**:

```text
.conductor/
├── modes/
│   └── discovery/
│       ├── current-session.md
│       ├── insights.json
│       └── conversation-state.json
├── project.md
└── config.json
```

**Success Criteria**:

- Generated `project.md` reflects discovered insights
- CLI provides clear feedback on discovery progress
- Users can resume previous conversations
- Basic problem statements emerge from dialogue

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Core classes and basic conversation flow
- **Integration Tests**: File operations and CLI commands
- **Manual Testing**: Basic discovery conversations with real users

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success

- [ ] Users can start and complete basic discovery conversations
- [ ] Insights are captured and persisted across sessions
- [ ] Basic project documents are generated from conversations
- [ ] CLI provides clear feedback and status information
