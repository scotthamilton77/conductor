# Discovery Mode Implementation: Phase 1 - Core Discovery Foundation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive Phase 1 implementation strategy for Discovery Mode within the Conductor framework. Phase 1 establishes the foundational architecture and delivers working discovery conversation capabilities that provide immediate user value while setting up the infrastructure for advanced features in subsequent phases.

**Phase 1 Goal**: Enable users to have productive discovery conversations with AI that capture insights, persist across sessions, and generate useful project artifacts.

**Duration**: 4-6 weeks (39-48 development days)
**Core Deliverable**: Basic but complete discovery conversation system with persistent state and artifact generation

## Refined Phase Goals

### Primary Success Criteria

Phase 1 delivers a working Discovery Mode that enables:

1. **Natural Conversation Initiation**: Users can start discovery with `/conductor discover "describe your idea"` and receive contextually appropriate first questions
2. **Socratic Questioning Flow**: AI guides users through problem exploration using proven questioning techniques that build understanding progressively
3. **Insight Capture & Analysis**: System extracts and categorizes key insights (stakeholders, constraints, goals, assumptions) during conversation
4. **Persistent Conversation State**: All conversation history, insights, and context persist reliably across sessions with seamless resumption
5. **Useful Artifact Generation**: System produces structured project documents that reflect discovered insights and provide planning foundation
6. **Clear Progress Visibility**: Users understand what's been discovered and have clear guidance on next steps

### Technical Architecture Goals

Phase 1 establishes the architectural foundation aligned with the comprehensive Discovery Mode architecture:

- **Strongly-typed ID system** with branded types (TopicId, SessionId, QuestionId, InsightId)
- **Core class hierarchy** following AbstractMode pattern with proper lifecycle management
- **FileOperations integration** using established .conductor/ directory patterns
- **AI service integration** through PromptManager with conversation context management
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful degradation and user guidance
- **Testing foundation** with unit, integration, and manual testing approaches

### User Experience Goals

Phase 1 delivers a conversation experience that:

- Feels natural and empathetic, not like an interrogation
- Builds understanding progressively without overwhelming users
- Provides clear feedback on discovery progress and next steps
- Enables easy pause/resume of conversations
- Produces genuinely useful outputs that justify time invested
